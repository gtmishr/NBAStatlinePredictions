# NBAMachineLearning
This is the first application of the (admittedly little) amount of Machine Learning content that I know. I aim to initially create a small programme that can guess whether a made up stat-line would be more likely to be performed by a certain player (using the most recent 2019 NBA finals stats), and then build out a a system that would use data from 1950 - 2017 to do the same thing (with better accuracy).
