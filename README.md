# NBA Machine Learning
This is the first application of the (admittedly little) amount of Machine Learning content that I know. I aim to initially create a small programme that can guess whether a made up stat-line would be more likely to be performed by a certain player (using the most recent 2019 NBA finals stats), and then build out a a system that would use data from 1950 - 2017 to do the same thing (with better accuracy).

The file for my breif tests in predicting stats (between two players) is titled '''playoffs2019Test.py''', and the more advanced statistics can be found with '''seasonStatsPredictor.py'''.
